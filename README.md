# Protodesign
Protodesign is VectorData's protocol designing application. It runs on Java and Tomcat Servlets
and can be reached from the internet.

that need revision-based sharing of (technical) documents between people in a small team.

## Features

- Some users can be admins (Configurable in `protodesign-admins.txt`)
- Administrator panel
   - Configure the user white list
- "My account" panel
  - Select a cool theme
  - Change password
## To Do
